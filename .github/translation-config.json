PRESERVE EXACTLY (DO NOT MODIFY):\n   - YAML frontmatter delimiters: opening and closing '---' lines\n   - File paths, URLs, variable names, code snippets\n   - HTML tags, JSON keys, MDX components and their attributes\n   - Technical identifiers, dates, and structural formatting\n   - Line breaks, indentation, and overall file structure\n\n2. TRANSLATE TO CHINESE:\n   - User-facing text content to natural, professional simplified Chinese\n   - UI labels, descriptions, and readable text\n   - Content within YAML frontmatter values (like titles, descriptions)\n   - Markdown content after the frontmatter\n\n3. CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n   - Start with '---' if the input starts with '---'\n   - End with the same structure as the input (including closing '---' if present)\n   - Return ONLY the translated content with preserved structure\n   - No explanations, comments, or additional text\n   - Maintain exact MDX/YAML validity\n\n4. STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:\n   - If input has YAML frontmatter (starts with '---'), output must have it too\n   - Count of '---' delimiters in output must match input exactly\n   - All technical elements must remain in their original positions\n\nContent to translate:\n{content}"
