Follow the [docs](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/support) to join YakShaver's Discord channel.\n\n2\\. In your [YakShaver portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/), add a project called 'Northwind' and set the backlog to this GitHub repo: [https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground)\n\n3\\. Check out the Shaving [best practices](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions).\n\n4. Set up a [Windows or Mac screenshot tool](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/recording-work-item-snipping-tool) by following the docs.\\\nNote: This gives you access to keyboard shortcuts\n\n5. Do a normal YakShave - go to [northwind365.com](https://northwind365.com/) and report that the size of the headings is too small.\n\n6. Do an unorthodox YakShave into the 'Northwind' project. In your recording:\n\n* Show the project's location in the portal, and its backlog\n* Demonstrate how you have set up your screen capture tool, and where the videos will go after being recorded\n* Explain why you must verbally mention the destination project and why you can't just rely on the screen\n* Scenario: A user complains to you that after recording in Teams, they have received no notification from the Yakshaver bot. What is your course of action?\n* Scenario: A user reports that their Shave went into the wrong backlog. How do you educate them to avoid the same mistake in the future?\n* Feedback: What is your opinion on YakShaver and what feedback would you like to give the team?\n\n7. We will review your video, and if successful you will receive a badge from [Credly](https://info.credly.com/).\n\n8.
