In your [YakShaver portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/), add a project called 'Northwind' and set the backlog to this public GitHub repo: [https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground)\n\n3\\. Set up a [Windows or Mac screenshot tool](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/recording-work-item-snipping-tool) by following the docs.\\\nNote: This gives you access to keyboard shortcuts\n\n4. Use YakShaver - do a Shave into the 'Northwind' project. In your recording, explain to us:\n\n* The project's location in the portal, and its backlog\n* How you have set up your screen capture tool, and where the videos will go after being recorded\n* Why you must verbally mention the destination project and why you can't just rely on the screen\n* How to manually retrigger a Shave\n\n5.
