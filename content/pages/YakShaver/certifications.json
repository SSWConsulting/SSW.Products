Upon successful completion your organization will receive 50 free credits valued at $25.\n\n1\\. In your YakShaver portal, add the YakShaver playground as a project\n[https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground)\n\n2\\. Do a test Shave into that project. In your Shave, explain to us:\n\n* \\- How you set up the tool you are using (Teams, snipping tool, etc.)\n* \\- Which project to send your Shave to (assume the AI canâ€™t understand what's on your screen)\n* \\- Where the project is shown in the portal, and how you know it has a working backlog\n* \\- How the video processing works - where does it go between being recorded and ending up in the backlog?\n\nThat's it! You will receive an email with your YakShaver Admin badge and instructions to claim your 50 credits.\n",
