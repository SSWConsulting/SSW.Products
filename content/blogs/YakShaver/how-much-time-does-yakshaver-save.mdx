Creating a high-quality work item, bug report, or PBI that meets the Definition of Ready in a Scrum project takes ***30 minutes on average***\*. This includes writing clear descriptions, acceptance criteria, and relevant details, along with refinement meetings and collaboration time, which typically account for 30â€“50% of the total effort. Complex items may take **6+ hours**, especially if they require deep technical discussions or dependencies on other teams.

YakShaver cuts down the time needed to create a Work Item by handling the heavy lifting with AI. Each Work Item saves around 30 minutes on average. This helps teams focus more on refining tasks in meetings and ensures items meet the Definition of Ready faster. Even complex items that require deep discussions or dependencies can be completed in less time, improving overall efficiency and collaboration.
