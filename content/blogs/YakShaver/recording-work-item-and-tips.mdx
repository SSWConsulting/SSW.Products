### Recording in a meeting or group call

4. When finished, stop the recording, which will send the video for processing

### Recording by yourself

### Tips to help YakShaver create the perfect work item

* State your intent: Begin the recording with your purpose
  * “Send an email task to…”
  * “I have a new feature request for SugarLearning…”
* Detail bug reports: For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour
  * “First do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this”
  * Have a look at tip #1 from [this rule](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)
* Auto CC: Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead
* Mention Additional Team Members: to include others who are not in the meeting
  * “… Cc Adam and Uly”
* Move PBIs: If the PBI was created in the wrong project, use the “Move PBI” option to relocate it to another project
