When you use SSW\.TimePro for invoicing international clients, sometimes you need to issue invoices in different currencies than your default one. Here is how you can set it up.

## Navigate to the Currencies setting

You can find the Currencies setting by

1. In the menu, go to Admin | Invoice Settings 
2. Scroll down to the **Currencies **section

## Activate multiple currencies

There are a few currencies out of the box that you can activate immediately. If you need additional currencies outside the list, please contact support for assistance.

To activate a new currency,

1. Put an Exchange Rate value for that currency
2. Click Save at the bottom

This exchange rate is determined by your company how currencies convert internally in your system. When you change the currency used for an invoice, this is the ratio by which the numbers will be converted. For instance, in the figure above, 1 USD = 7 CNY.

## Choosing currencies for your invoice

Now you can use all the activated currencies on your invoice. 

1. In the menu, go to Invoices | New Invoice
2. In the Invoice Currency field, choose a currency for your invoice
