## Add a new PDF Template

TimePro uses SQL Server Reporting Services to generate PDF from invoices. You are given a designated template folder to host all your .rdl files upon initializing your TimePro instance.

To add a new template,

1. Click the "+" icon next to the last template
2. Fill in the corresponding .rdl file name in your template folder
3. Choose a Category for the new template. e.g. “Invoice” if you're using this new template for invoice PDF.
4. Click “Save” at the bottom
