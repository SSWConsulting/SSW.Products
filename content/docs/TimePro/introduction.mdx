Efficient time tracking is critical for accurate billing and resource allocation, yet manual entry is often time-consuming and prone to error. SSW TimePro is a comprehensive enterprise solution designed to streamline staff timesheets, invoicing, receipting, and leave management. By focusing on automation and integration, it significantly reduces the administrative burden on consultants and developers, allowing organizations to focus on project delivery rather than overhead.

## 🔍 How It Works
SSW TimePro acts as a central hub for business administration, accessible directly via a web browser with no client-side installation required. It utilizes a data-driven approach to populate timesheets by integrating with development environments and analyzing historical work patterns.
The system automates data entry through three primary mechanisms:

- 💻 **Azure DevOps Integration** – Automatically pulls check-in comments and linked PBIs from Azure DevOps to generate accurate time entries based on actual development activity.
- 🧠 **Suggested Timesheets** – Leverages algorithms to analyze previous entries and user patterns to pre-populate upcoming timesheets, requiring only a quick review.
- 📝 **Suggested Comments** – Generates automatic summaries of tasks performed, ensuring clients receive detailed work descriptions without manual typing.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📊 **Reporting & Analytics** - Features 5 inbuilt reporting modules for timesheets, invoices, and expenses. For advanced analytics, the system supports ad hoc reporting via Power BI integration.
- 🏷️ **EasyLeave Management** - A centralized module for submitting leave requests, viewing team availability, and configuring public holidays to ensure accurate capacity planning.
- ⚙️ **Recurring Invoicing** - Automates the billing process by generating and sending invoices on a defined schedule, ideal for retainer agreements and subscription services.
- 🤝 **Dynamics 365 Sync** - Provides deep integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 to synchronize client data, projects, and invoices seamlessly.

## 🎯 Why Choose SSW TimePro?
- **Automated Efficiency** – Reduces the time spent on weekly administrative tasks from 20-30 minutes to under 2 minutes through intelligent automation.
