## 🎯 Why Choose SSW TimePro?

#### **Built for how you work**

Workflow is designed for fast timesheeting and quick invoicing e.g. “get timesheets done in 30 seconds”, not generic project management.

#### **Continuously improved**

Actively developed with a clear roadmap: GitHub integration, more automation, and ongoing UX and performance improvements.
