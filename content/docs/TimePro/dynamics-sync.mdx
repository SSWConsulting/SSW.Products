## Setup your Dynamics 365 Configuration

If Dynamics 365 is not yet configured, you will need to add a connection. If it is already configured, click Edit to update the settings. 

1. Dynamics 365 Connection Type - choose between Active Directory (OnPrem) for on-premises Dynamics 365 or Client Secret (Cloud) for Dynamics 365/Dataverse in the cloud

The next fields will depend on the connection type you chose before:

### Active Directory (OnPrem)

1. Dynamics 365 URL - Enter your Dynamics 365 URL - e.g. \`northwind.crm.dynamics.com\`
2. Dynamics 365 Login - Enter your Active Directory login 
3. Dynamics 365 Password - Enter your Active Directory password
4. Domain - Enter your Active Directory domain

### Client Secret (Cloud)

1. Dynamics 365 URL - Enter your Dynamics 365 URL - e.g. \`northwind.crm.dynamics.com\`
2. Dynamics 365 Client Id - Enter your Cloud Client Id
3. Dynamics 365 Client secret - Enter your Cloud Client secret

## Test and Save the Connection

1. Click Test connection to verify the connection works.
2. Once the test succeeds, click Save. This will save your settings in your tenant database.

## Run the sync

1. Back on the Dynamics 365 page, click the Sync button.
2. In the Sync with Dynamics 365 dialog, select a Sync Range - from Last 24 hours to Full sync.
3. Click Start Sync.

Wait for the sync to complete. The page shows "Sync in progress..." while running, then displays "Sync completed" a result with how many entities were created and updated.

## View the Synced Clients

Go to Admin and choose between Users, Clients or Projects. The synced data from Dynamics 365 now appears in each of these categories.

## What Gets Synced

The sync imports Users, Clients, and Projects from Dynamics 365 into TimePro. The sync only adds or updates records - it does not delete records in either system. Any Dynamics 365 entities updated within the selected sync range will be imported.
