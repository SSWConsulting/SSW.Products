According to a ChatGPT \[Deep Research]\([https://chatgpt.com/share/67d8bdb0-0f60-800d-af20-baba64a9a2eb?](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d8bdb0-0f60-800d-af20-baba64a9a2eb?)):


Creating a high-quality work item, bug report, or PBI that meets the Definition of Ready in a Scrum project takes 2 to 4 hours on average. This includes writing clear descriptions, acceptance criteria, and relevant details, along with refinement meetings and collaboration time, which typically account for 30â€“50% of the total effort. Complex items may take 6+ hours, especially if they require deep technical discussions or dependencies on other teams.
