If you are on Windows, here's how you can set up the inbuilt [Snipping Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b) to get your videos processed by YakShaver!

### Setting up Snipping Tool

3\. Snipping Tool | Press "Windows" and search up "Snipping Tool" to open the Snipping Tool App

4\. Snipping Tool | Settings | In the "Screen recording" section, change the folder to the `SnippingTool` folder you just created, and turn on microphone input by default

### Recording a video with Screenshot App

1\. Snipping Tool | Press `Windows + Shift + R` to open Snipping Tool in Recording mode

2\. Snipping Tool | Select your recording window and record

3\. When done, stop the recording and wait for YakShaver to process the video

Hint: You can also use other shortcuts (CMD + Shift + (3/4/6)) to immediately start recording.
