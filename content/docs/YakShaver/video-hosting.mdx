By default, the **"Watch the video"** link in a work item points to a publicly unlisted video hosted on **Microsoft Stream** via **SharePoint**. This setup provides secure access and automatic transcript support, while still allowing easy sharing with people inside and outside the organization.

Weâ€™re actively expanding video hosting options. A planned feature will allow clients to assign a **YouTube channel per Project**, offering greater flexibility for public or semi-public sharing. This will be especially useful for users working with more sensitive or externally-facing content.
