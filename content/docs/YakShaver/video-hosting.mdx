By default, the **"Watch the video"** link in a work item points to a publicly unlisted video hosted on **Microsoft Stream** via **SharePoint**. This setup provides secure access and automatic transcript support, while still allowing easy sharing with people inside and outside the organization.

## SharePoint vs YouTube Hosting

### SharePoint (Default - Recommended)
- **Security**: Full control over video access through your organization's SharePoint instance
- **Scalability**: No daily upload limits
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Microsoft ecosystem
- **Transcripts**: Automatic transcript support
- **Best Practice**: Links expire after 30 days for security and content management

### YouTube (Optional)
- **Permanence**: Videos don't expire (unlike SharePoint's 30-day default)
- **Public sharing**: Better for content that may be shared outside your organization
- **Limitations**:
  - Daily quota of ~100 video uploads per channel per day
  - Less secure - if unlisted links are accidentally shared, anyone can access them
  - No organizational control over access permissions

**Note**: SharePoint's 30-day link expiry is a security best practice. For high-volume usage or when permanent access is required, YouTube hosting is available but comes with daily upload limits and security considerations.
