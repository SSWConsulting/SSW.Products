### How To Setup Other Recording Tools (e.g. Snagit)

Getting Teams to share a screen and start recording is quite a few clicks...
If you want to be a power user and speak to YakShaver just by pressing the "Print Screen" button on your keyboard, use a recording tool such as Snagit rather than MS Teams.

1. Snagit | Ensure that "All-in-one" is selected, and your "Capture" hotkey is set (you can choose your favourite, but we suggest "Print Screen")

1. YakShaver | Type **off** in the YakShaver Teams bot. This is to prevent processing your old videos
2. Snagit | Change the default saving directory to OneDrive's recording's folder, i.e. `OneDrive/Recordings/Snagit/`
3. Restart Snagit and ignore the "Asking Cards" from YakShaver unless you want to process them
4. YakShaver | Type **on** in the YakShaver Teams bot
5. Snagit | Press "Print Screen" and choose the video option, then start recording
