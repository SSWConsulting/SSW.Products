8. ✅ Done - You will receive one of the 3 email types (based on the project):   

   a. The email task itself   
   b. GitHub email notification with a link to the Issue   
   c. Azure DevOps email notification with a link to the PBI

### Tips to help YakShaver create the perfect work item

* **State your intent** - Begin the recording with the purpose. E.g.:   
  
   *“Send an email task to...”*   
   *“I have a new feature request for SugarLearning...”*

* **Detail bug reports** - For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour. E.g.:   
   
   *“First do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this”*
  
   **Note:** Have a look at [Tip #1 - Draft your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

* **Mention additional team members** to include others who are not in the meeting. E.g:   

   *“...Cc Adam and Uly”*

   **Note:** Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead.

* **Move PBIs** - If the PBI was created in the wrong project, use the “Move PBI” option to relocate it to another project.
