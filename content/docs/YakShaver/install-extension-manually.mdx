For users who cannot access the Chrome Web Store (particularly users in China), then this guide helps you to install it manually.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the CRX File

1. \[Download the YakShaver Extension CRX File]\(/YakShaver/Docs/yakshaver-extension.crx)
2. The file will be saved into your Downloads folder
3. Chrome will attempt to install the extension automatically and show a notification saying you cannot install it, but don't worry we will install it manually in the next steps

### Step 2: Open Chrome Extension Management

1. Open Google Chrome and in the address bar, type chrome://extensions; it’ll open the Google Chrome extensions page
2. Make sure that “My extensions” is selected in the sidebar
3. Enable "Developer mode" on top right
