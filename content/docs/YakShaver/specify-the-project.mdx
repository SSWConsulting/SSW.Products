If it doesn't know which project to target, it must ask the user for confirmation, which slows down the process.

Since YakShaver does not read the screen that you are recording, the best way to inform it of the target project is in your speech.

The recommended way to do this is to mention the destination project when you begin the Shave.

`"Please create a work item in the Northwind project"`
`"I have noticed a problem on the YakShaver website"`
