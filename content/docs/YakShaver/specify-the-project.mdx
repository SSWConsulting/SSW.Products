When YakShaver doesn't know which project to target, it asks the user which slows down the process. The best way to avoid this is verbally mentioning the target project (YakShaver does not read your screen).

We recommended verbally specifying the project when you begin the Shave.

`"Please create a work item in the Northwind project"`

`"I have noticed a problem on the YakShaver website"`
