If a user has done a recording, but YakShaver remains silent - continue down these steps until the issue is resolved.

## 1. Test:

* 1a. Run the `help` command. This checks if the YakShaver bot is responding

![yakshaver help response](/YakShaver/Docs/yakshaver-help.jpg)**Figure: this means YakShaver is responding ðŸŸ¢**

## 2. If the bot responds:

* 2a. In the [YakShaver Portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai) navigate to `My Shaves`
* 2b. Check the status of your recent shave and re-run it if the option is available
* 2c. If your recent shave does not appear (or you cannot re-run it), continue to step 3

## 3. Otherwise:

#### If recorded through Teams

* 3a. Find the recording file in the One Drive folder, then duplicate the file in the same folder. This will trigger a new shave
* 3b. If the recording file does not exist, record a new video in Teams (restart from the beginning). If the issue persists, try another recording tool or contact YakShaver support

#### If recorded through a supported 3rd party tool

* 3c. Find the recording file in the One Drive folder
* 3d. If the video does not exist, most likely the recording tool is misconfigured. See: [https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools](https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools)
* 3e. If the video exists, check if your One Drive service is turned on. If so, go to step 3a above
* 3f. If OneDrive is off, turn it on and record a new video (restart from the beginning)

## 4. Seek out community support in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Jp9dyxKFjR) or contact YakShaver support
