If a user has done a recording, but YakShaver remains silent - continue down these steps until the issue is resolved.

## 1. Test if YakShaver is alive

* A. Run the /help command. This checks if the YakShaver bot is responding

![yakshaver help response](/YakShaver/Docs/yakshaver-help.jpg)**Figure: this means YakShaver is responding ðŸŸ¢**

## 2. If YakShaver doesn't respond

* A. Check [YakShaver's health](https://api.yakshaver.ai/health)
* B. If YakShaver is not healthy, rest assured the team is already aware and it will be back online shortly. Feel free to email us to confirm.

## 3. If Yakshaver is healthy

* A. Navigate to **[YakShaver Portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai) | My Shaves**
* B. Check the status of your recent shave and re-run (if available).
  This can happen when the Shave is pending because the user has not answered a question from the bot (like which project backlog to use).
* C. If your recent shave does not appear (or you cannot re-run it), continue to step 4

## 4. If the above steps haven't worked

#### If recorded through Teams

* A. Find the recording file in the OneDrive folder, then duplicate the file in the same folder. This will trigger a new shave
* B. If the recording file does not exist, record a new video in Teams (restart from the beginning). If the issue persists, try another recording tool or contact [YakShaver support](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/support)

#### If recorded through a supported 3rd party tool

* C. Find the recording file in the OneDrive folder
* D. If the video does not exist, check the recording tool is configured properly. See: [https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools](https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools)
* E. If the video exists, check if the OneDrive service is turned on. If so, go to step 4a above
* F. If OneDrive is off, turn it on and YakShaver will pick up the new video
