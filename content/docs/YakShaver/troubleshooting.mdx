It might happen that a user has done a recording, but YakShaver does not respond. To debug the problem:

1. Check the YakShaver bot to make sure it's working and responding - use the `help` command and YakShaver will send back a respone card:
<insert screenshot of `status` response>

2. If the bot responds, open the [YakShaver Portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai) and the `My Shaves` page.  
If your recent shave appears, you can check the status and re-run it if the option is available.  
If this does not resolve the problem, continue with the steps below.

3. Depending on which way you recorded there are different checks you can perform:
 * Recorded through Teams
       3b. Check the one drive folder to see if the recording file exists.
              If it does, duplicate the file in the same folder. This will trigger a new shave.
              If the recording file does not exist, record a new video in Teams (restart from the beginning). If the issue persist, try another recording tool or contact YakShaver support. 
 * Recorded through supported 3rd party tool
       Check your one drive folder. If video does not exist, most likely tool is misconfigured follow the steps for the supported tool : https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools
       If the video exists, check if your one drive service is turned on. If so, follow step 3b above. 
       If it is not turned on, turn it on and record a new video (restart from the beginning).
