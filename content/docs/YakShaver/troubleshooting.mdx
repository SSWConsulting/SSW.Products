It might happen that a user has done a recording, but YakShaver does not respond. To debug the problem:

1. Check the YakShaver bot to make sure it's working and responding - use the `help` command and YakShaver will send back a respone card:
<insert screenshot of `status` response>

2. If the bot responds, follow the link to the YakShaver Portal (https://portal.yakshaver.ai) and have a look at the `My Shaves` page and if your recent shaves appears there and with what status.
If available, you can try and re-run. If this does not resolve the problem

// TODO: fill out more details
3. Then depending where or how you recorded there are different checks you can perform
 * Recorded through Teams
       check the one drive folder and re-trigger the shave 
 * Recorded through Chrome Extension
       // TODO: not sure yet what the possibilities are here
 * Recorded through supported 3rd party tool
      check the one drive folder, if video does not exist then most likely tool is misconfigured follow the steps for the supported tool : https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools
4. Seek out community support or contact technical support
