It might happen that a user has done a recording, but YakShaver does not respond.

Continue down the steps below until your issue is resolved.

### 1. Test the bot
       1a. Run the `help` command and YakShaver will send back a respone card (this checks if the bot is responding)
<insert screenshot of `status` response>

### 2. If the bot responds
       2a. Open the [YakShaver Portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai) and the `My Shaves` page.  
       2b. If your recent shave appears, you can check the status and re-run it if the option is available.  

### 3. Otherwise
The next checks depend on how the Shave was recorded.

##### If recorded through Teams
       3a. Find the recording file in the One Drive folder, then duplicate the file in the same folder. This will trigger a new shave.
       3b. If the recording file does not exist, record a new video in Teams (restart from the beginning). If the issue persists, try another recording tool or contact YakShaver support.

##### If recorded through a supported 3rd party tool
       3c. Find the recording file in the One Drive folder.
       3d. If the video does not exist, most likely the recording tool is misconfigured. See: [https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools](https://yakshaver.ai/docs#Supported-Tools)
       3e. If the video exists, check if your One Drive service is turned on. If so, go to step 3a above. 
       3f. If OneDrive is off, turn it on and record a new video (restart from the beginning).
       
4. Seek out community support in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Jp9dyxKFjR) or contact YakShaver support
