## Before Recording

💡 **Important:** Navigate to the webpage you want to record before starting. Browser system pages (like chrome://extensions) don't support screen recording.

2. Enter your name and email address
3. Based on your requirements, you can share your computer sound here (note it's different than Microphone permission)
4. Click "Start Recording" to begin capturing your screen
