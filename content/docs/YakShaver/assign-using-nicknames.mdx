YakShaver lets you assign work more naturally by using nicknames for users. Once a nickname is set, it becomes interchangeable with the user’s actual name - YakShaver will recognize either one when mentioned in a shave.

## How it works

1. Set a nickname - In the Portal, Go to [User Settings](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/users), select a user, and add a nickname in the Edit User screen. Each user can have only one nickname at a time.
2. Automatic detection - When a user is mentioned by either their name or nickname in a recording, YakShaver detects the mention and links it to the correct user.
3. Name interchangeability - Once set, the nickname functions exactly like the user’s real name when referenced. You can assign work using either.

### Example

* You set **Bob Northwind**’s nickname to **Windy**.
* In a shave, someone mentions: "Assign this to **Windy**"
* YakShaver knows **Windy** is **Bob Northwind** and assigns the work item appropriately

### Notes

* Nicknames are case-insensitive
* Only one nickname per user
* No restrictions on length or special characters
* You can change or remove the nickname anytime from the same page
