# Using YakShaver with Third-Party Recording Tools

YakShaver works with a variety of third-party recording tools, giving you more flexibility and the ability to use keyboard shortcuts for faster workflows.

## How It Works

When configured correctly, YakShaver monitors specific folders in your OneDrive for new recordings. When it finds a new recording, it automatically processes it into a work item.

## Supported Video Formats

- .mp4
- .mov

## Setup with Snagit (Recommended)

[Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) is a popular screen recording tool that works seamlessly with YakShaver.

### Initial Setup

1. Open Snagit Editor
2. Go to **Edit | Editor Preferences**
3. Open the **Library** tab
4. Change the library location to your OneDrive Recordings folder:  
   `OneDrive/Recordings/Snagit/`
5. Click **OK** (you'll be prompted to restart Snagit)

### Configuring Keyboard Shortcuts

To become a power user, set up keyboard shortcuts for quick recording:

1. In Snagit, ensure that "All-in-one" is selected
2. Set your "Capture" hotkey (we recommend using "Print Screen")

### Important YakShaver Configuration

1. Open YakShaver in Microsoft Teams
2. Type **OFF** in the YakShaver Teams bot  
   (This prevents processing of old videos during setup)
3. After configuring Snagit, type **ON** in YakShaver to reactivate processing

### Recording with Snagit

1. Press your configured hotkey (e.g., "Print Screen")
2. Select the video recording option
3. Record your screen while explaining the task
4. Stop the recording when finished
5. YakShaver will automatically process the recording

## Windows Snipping Tool

The built-in Windows Snipping Tool can also be configured to work with YakShaver.

1. Open Windows Settings > System > Storage
2. Under "Save locations", set Videos to your OneDrive folder:  
   `OneDrive/Recordings/SnippingTool/`
3. Open Snipping Tool settings and ensure recordings save to this location

## Other Recording Tools

You can use almost any recording tool with YakShaver if it can save to a specific folder. Just configure your tool to save recordings to:

`OneDrive/Recordings/[ToolName]/`

## Troubleshooting

- **Videos not being processed?**  
  Check that you've typed **ON** in the YakShaver Teams bot
  
- **Wrong file format?**  
  Ensure your recording tool is saving in .mp4 or .mov format
  
- **Files saved to wrong location?**  
  Double-check the save location in your recording tool's settings
