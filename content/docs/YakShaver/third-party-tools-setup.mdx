While [Microsoft Teams](recording-work-item-teams) and the [browser extension](recording-work-item-browser-extension) are the recommended ways to get started with YakShaver, we also support a variety of third-party recording tools. These tools offer additional flexibility and features like keyboard shortcuts for power users who want to optimize their workflow.

## How It Works

When configured correctly, YakShaver monitors specific folders in your OneDrive for new recordings. When it finds a new recording, it automatically processes it into a work item.

## Setup with Snagit

[Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) is a popular screen recording tool that works seamlessly with YakShaver. For detailed usage instructions after setup, see our [Recording with Snagit Guide](recording-work-item-snagit).

### Initial Setup

1. Open Snagit Editor
2. Go to **Edit | Editor Preferences**
3. Open the **Library** tab
4. Change the library location to your OneDrive Recordings folder:\
   `OneDrive/Recordings/Snagit/`
5. Click **OK** (you'll be prompted to restart Snagit)

### Configuring Keyboard Shortcuts

To become a power user, set up keyboard shortcuts for quick recording:

1. In Snagit, ensure that "All-in-one" is selected
2. Set your "Capture" hotkey (we recommend using "Print Screen")

3. Record your screen while explaining the task
4. Stop the recording when finished
5. YakShaver will automatically process the recording

## Other Recording Tools

You can use almost any recording tool with YakShaver if it can save to a specific folder. Just configure your tool to save recordings to:

`OneDrive/Recordings/[ToolName]/`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Wrong file format?**\
  Ensure your recording tool is saving in .mp4 or .mov format
* **Files saved to wrong location?**\
  Double-check the save location in your recording tool's settings
