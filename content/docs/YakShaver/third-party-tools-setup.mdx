YakShaver works best with [Microsoft Teams](recording-work-item-teams), but you can use any recording app you prefer.

## What to do:

1\. Open the recording software that you use

2\. Make sure the recording is saved somewhere inside this folder in OneDrive:

`OneDrive → Recordings → {{ ANY FOLDER YOU WANT }}`

3\. Done! YakShaver will now automatically detect the video when it is saved.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Wrong file format?**\
  Ensure your recording tool is saving in .mp4 or .mov format
* **Files saved to wrong location?**\
  Double-check the save location in your recording tool's settings
