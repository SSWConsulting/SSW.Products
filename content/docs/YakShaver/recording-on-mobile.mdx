Need to YakShave from your phone? You’ve got two easy options:

## Option 1: Recording with your mobile phone

You can record either with the **camera app** or by **recording your screen**. In both cases, upload the video to **OneDrive → Recordings**, and YakShaver will automatically process it.

##### Prerequisites

* OneDrive App installed, signed in to the account you want the YakShave to be picked up from
