When using YakShaver to automate user mentions in Work Item descriptions, it's important to understand when and why users are mentioned. 

YakShaver will mention users in the Work Item description if they meet one of the following criteria:

1. They are in one of the following roles (critical to the Work Item's success):
   * Work Item requester
   * Product Owner 
     * Secondary Product Owner (if present)
   * Tech Lead
   * Scrum Master

2. They were explicitly mentioned in the video
   * If a user is explicitly referenced or tagged in the video associated with the Work Item, YakShaver will include them in the description

These guidelines are designed to:

* Keep Work Item descriptions clean and concise
* Ensure only relevant stakeholders are notified or highlighted
* Avoid unnecessary noise or distractions for users who are not directly involved
