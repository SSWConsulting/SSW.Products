When using YakShaver to automate user mentions in Work Item descriptions, itâ€™s important to understand when and why users are mentioned. YakShaver will only mention users in the Work Item description if they meet one of the following criteria:

1. The following roles are **always mentioned** because they are critical to the Work Item's success:
   * Work Item Requester
   * Product Owner and Secondary Product Owner (if present)
   * Tech Lead
   * Scrum Master
2. User Explicitly Mentioned in the Video
   * If a user is explicitly referenced or tagged in the video associated with the Work Item, YakShaver will include them in the description.

## **Why These Rules Exist**

These guidelines are designed to:

* Keep Work Item descriptions clean and concise.
* Ensure only relevant stakeholders are notified or highlighted.
* Avoid unnecessary noise or distractions for users who are not directly involved.
