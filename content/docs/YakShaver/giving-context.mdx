It’s important to provide context to YakShaver so it can generate Work Items with accurate descriptions and acceptance criterias.

When recording your screen to show a part of your application that needs updating, we recommend verbally mentioning the heading of the relevant section. Since YakShaver cannot read your screen, this is the most reliable way to give it context.

For example, if you're talking about a section on the right of a page, refer to it by saying

`On the right, the Authors section needs to be moved to…`
