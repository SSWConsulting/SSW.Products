For users who cannot access the Chrome Web Store (particularly users in China), you can install the YakShaver Chrome extension using a CRX file. This method allows you to manually install the extension without needing VPN access to the Chrome Web Store.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the CRX File

1. Click the download link for the YakShaver extension CRX file: [Download YakShaver Extension](https://your-azure-storage-url/yakshaver-extension.crx)
2. The file will automatically download to your Downloads folder
3. Chrome will attempt to install the extension automatically and show a notification saying you cannot install it
4. **Important:** Dismiss this notification - we will install it manually in the next steps
