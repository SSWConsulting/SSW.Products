Need fewer (or more) monthly credits? You can move between **Starter**, **Team**, and **Growth** whenever you like.  \
When you switch to a **smaller** plan, the change is **scheduled** for your **next billing cycle** so you keep everything you've already paid for this month.
Switching **up** takes effect immediately

## How to switch to a different plan

1. Go to **[Subscriptions](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/plan)**.
2. Click **Manage Subscription**.
3. Select the plan you want and confirm.
