If you no longer need as many monthly credits, you can move from **Growth → Team** or **Team → Starter** any time.\
A downgrade is **scheduled** for your **next billing cycle**, so you keep everything you've already paid for this month.

## How to schedule a downgrade

1. Go to [Subscriptions](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/plan)
2. Click "Manage Subscription"
3. Select the plan you want to downgrade to and confirm.

That's it! The change is queued and takes effect on your next billing cycle.
