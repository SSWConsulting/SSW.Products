## üìÅ OneDrive Folder Structure

YakShaver monitors your OneDrive `/Recordings` folder and will automatically process any video files it finds, regardless of how they're organized within that folder structure.

### Supported Folder Structures

YakShaver works with flexible folder organization:

‚úÖ **Direct placement:**
```
OneDrive/Recordings/video.mp4
```

‚úÖ **Tool-specific folders:**
```
OneDrive/Recordings/Teams/video.mp4
OneDrive/Recordings/Snagit/video.mp4
OneDrive/Recordings/SnippingTool/video.mp4
```

‚úÖ **Project-based organization:**
```
OneDrive/Recordings/Projects/MyProject/video.mp4
OneDrive/Recordings/ClientWork/CompanyA/video.mp4
```

‚úÖ **Date-based organization:**
```
OneDrive/Recordings/2025/January/video.mp4
OneDrive/Recordings/2025/Week03/video.mp4
```

‚úÖ **Mixed organization:**
```
OneDrive/Recordings/Teams/2025/ProjectA/video.mp4
OneDrive/Recordings/Personal/Ideas/video.mp4
```

### Key Points

- **Automatic Detection:** YakShaver scans the entire `/Recordings` folder tree
- **Flexible Structure:** Organize recordings in any subfolder structure that works for you
- **No Naming Restrictions:** Folder names don't need to follow specific conventions
- **Nested Folders:** You can create folders within folders as deep as needed

### Best Practices

- Create tool-specific folders (e.g., `Teams`, `Snagit`, `SnippingTool`) to keep recordings organized
- Use project or client-based folders for work organization
- Consider date-based folders for long-term archival
- Avoid spaces in folder names to prevent potential issues with some tools

üí° **Tip:** You can reorganize your folder structure at any time - YakShaver will continue to process videos regardless of where they're located under `/Recordings`.
