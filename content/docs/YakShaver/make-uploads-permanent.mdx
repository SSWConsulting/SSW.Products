## Making Videos Permanent

If you want your videos to remain permanently available, you can connect your **YouTube** account to the project. Once connected, uploaded videos will be published to your YouTube account and won't expire.

**⚠️ YouTube Limitations:**

* **Daily Upload Quota:** YouTube allows only \~100 video uploads per verified channel per day. For high-volume usage, this may cause processing delays when the quota is reached.
* **Security Considerations:** YouTube videos are hosted outside your organization's infrastructure. If unlisted links are accidentally shared, anyone with the link can access them.
* **Confidentiality considerations:** If your video contains confidential information, even when unlisted, can lead to the video being removed by YouTube. See YouTube's Community Guidelines.

## How to set up YouTube uploads:

1. Go to the project where you want to upload videos through the [portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/projects)
2. [Connect your YouTube account](/docs/connect-your-youtube-channel-to-a-project) (if you haven't already)
3. Create a shave for that project - it will be published to your YouTube channel unlisted and won't expire

**Note**: The 30-day expiry for SharePoint links is a security best practice to ensure content remains current and reduces long-term storage and security risks. YouTube hosting should only be used when permanent access is truly required, keeping in mind the daily upload limits and security considerations.
