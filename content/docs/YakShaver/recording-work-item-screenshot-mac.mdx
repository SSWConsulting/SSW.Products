If you are on Mac, here's how you can set up the inbuilt [Screenshots App](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mh26782/mac) to get your videos processed by YakShaver!

### Setting up the Screenshot App

1. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: YakShaver | Type OFF in the YakShaver Teams bot. This will prevent old videos from being processed.
2. In your OneDrive Recordings' folder, create a new Folder called ScreenshotApp, i.e. `OneDrive/Recordings/ScreenshotApp/`
3. Screenshot App | Press CMD + Shift + 5 to open the Screenshot App
4. Screenshot App | Options | In the "Save to" section, select "Other Location", and choose the ScreenshotApp folder you created earlier

### Recording a video with Screenshot App

1. Screenshot App | Press CMD + Shift + 5 to open the Screenshot App
2. Screenshot App | Select your recording window and record
3. When done, stop the recording and wait for YakShaver to process the video

Hint: You can also use other shortcuts (CMD + Shift + (3/4/6)) to immediately start recording.
