## What Happens Next

After processing your recording, YakShaver will create a work item and notify you via:

1. A Teams message confirmation
2. One of these email types (depending on your project setup):
   * The email task itself
   * GitHub issue notification with a link
   * Azure DevOps work item notification with a link

## Chat Commands

You can control YakShaver with these commands in the Teams chat:

* `help` - Show list of commands
* `on` - Set YakShaver to always process your videos
* `ask`- Set YakShaver to ask before processing
* `off` - Set YakShaver to never process your videos
* `status` - Check your current settings
* `leaderboard` - View the leaderboard
* `hi` - Display welcome message

## Tips & Troubleshooting

* **Want more control?** Type `ask` in the YakShaver chat, and it will ask you before processing new recordings.
* **Want to cancel during recording?** Say "abort," "cancel the task," or "never mind."
* **Need a work item instead of email?** Use the conversion button in the email.
