## What Happens Next

After processing your recording, YakShaver will create a work item and notify you via:

1. A Teams message confirmation
2. One of these email types (depending on your project setup):
   - The email task itself
   - GitHub issue notification with a link
   - Azure DevOps work item notification with a link

## Chat Commands

You can control YakShaver with these commands in the Teams chat:

- `on` - Set YakShaver to always process your videos
- `off` - Set YakShaver to ask before processing
- `status` - Check your current settings
- `leaderboard` - View the leaderboard
- `help` - Show list of commands
- `hi` - Display welcome message

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Forgot to turn it on?** YakShaver will ask if you want to process new recordings.
- **Want to cancel during recording?** Say "abort," "cancel the task," or "never mind."
- **Need a work item instead of email?** Use the conversion button in the email.
