2. Click **More | Record and Transcribe | Start Recording**
3. (Wait for the recording to start) **Record the task** for YakShaver to process
4. When finished, **stop the recording**, which will send the video for processing

## Recording by yourself

7. âœ… Done - You will receive one of the 3 email types (based on the project):

   * A. The email task itself
   * B. Azure DevOps email notification with a link to the PBI
   * C. GitHub email notification with a link to the Issue
