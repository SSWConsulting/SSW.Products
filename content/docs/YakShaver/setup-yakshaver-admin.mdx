## Connect YakShaver to Microsoft Entra ID (required)

YakShaver connects to your Microsoft 365 tenant using Microsoft Entra ID. It’s a multi‑tenant cloud app that uses the admin‑consent flow to request Microsoft Graph application permissions (organisation‑wide, service‑to‑service access). Your tenant admin approves access once for your organisation. YakShaver does not create resources in your tenant.

Who is this for

* Tenant admins who can approve access: Global Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator
* End users simply sign in to YakShaver after approval (if sign‑in is used), but they don’t grant tenant‑wide access

Application permissions:

* User.Read.All - read all users' basic profiles across the directory (used to list/select users)
* Channel.ReadBasic.All - read basic details of Teams channels across the tenant
* Team.ReadBasic.All - read basic details of Teams across the tenant
* Files.Read.All - read files across the organisation (used for accessing videos in OneDrive/SharePoint features)

Delegated permissions:

* profile, openid, email
* User.Read

## Connect YakShaver to Azure DevOps (optional)

YakShaver can connect to your Azure DevOps organization using Microsoft Entra ID for enhanced project management features. It's a multi‑tenant cloud app that uses the admin‑consent flow to request Azure DevOps application permissions (organisation‑wide access to projects, users, and work items). Your tenant admin approves access once for your organisation. YakShaver does not create resources in your Azure DevOps tenant.

Who is this for

* Tenant admins who can approve access: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or Azure DevOps Organization Administrator
* End users simply sign in to YakShaver after approval, but they don't grant organization‑wide access

Application permissions:

* vso.graph - read organizational structure, groups, and team memberships across Azure DevOps (used to understand your org structure)
* vso.identity - read user and group identity information across the organization (allows us to query certain users)
* vso.memberentitlementmanagement - manage user licenses and access levels organization‑wide (allows us to select users with licenses only)
* vso.profile - read and write user profile information across Azure DevOps (get profile information)
* vso.project - read and manage projects, teams, and project settings organization‑wide (used to read project information)
* vso.work\_write - create, read, update work items, boards, and queries across all projects (used to create work items)

Delegated permissions:

* User.Read - read the signed‑in user's basic profile from Microsoft Graph
* user\_impersonation - access Azure DevOps services on behalf of the signed‑in user

## Connect YakShaver to GitHub (optional)

YakShaver can connect to your GitHub organization for enhanced code repository management and project integration. It's a GitHub App that uses OAuth authorization to request repository and user permissions. Organization owners can approve access for the entire organization, or individual users can authorize access to their personal repositories. YakShaver does not create resources in your GitHub account.

Who is this for

* Organization owners who can approve organization‑wide access to all repositories
* Individual users can authorize access to their own repositories and public repositories

Repository permissions:

* Read access to metadata - read basic repository information, branches, and settings (used to get project information)
* Read and write access to code, issues, organization projects, and repository projects - full access to repository content, issue tracking, and project boards (used to create and update work items in projects)

User permissions:

* Read access to email addresses - access your primary email address and public email information (used for user identification)

Installation scope:

* All repositories - applies to all current and future repositories owned by the resource owner, including public repositories (read‑only access to public repos)
* Individual repository selection also available during installation
