## Connect YakShaver to Microsoft Entra ID (required)

YakShaver connects to your Microsoft 365 tenant using Microsoft Entra ID. It’s a multi‑tenant cloud app that uses the admin‑consent flow to request Microsoft Graph application permissions (organisation‑wide, service‑to‑service access). Your tenant admin approves access once for your organisation. YakShaver does not create resources in your tenant.

Who is this for

* Tenant admins who can approve access: Global Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator
* End users simply sign in to YakShaver after approval (if sign‑in is used), but they don’t grant tenant‑wide access

Application permissions:

* User.Read.All - read all users' basic profiles across the directory (used to list/select users)
* Channel.ReadBasic.All - read basic details of Teams channels across the tenant
* Team.ReadBasic.All - read basic details of Teams across the tenant
* Files.Read.All - read files across the organisation (used for accessing videos in OneDrive/SharePoint features)

Delegated permissions:

* profile, openid, email
* User.Read

## Connect YakShaver to Azure DevOps (optional)

YakShaver can connect to your Azure DevOps organization using Microsoft Entra ID for enhanced project management features. It's a multi‑tenant cloud app that uses the admin‑consent flow to request Azure DevOps application permissions (organisation‑wide access to projects, users, and work items). Your tenant admin approves access once for your organisation. YakShaver does not create resources in your Azure DevOps tenant.

Who is this for

* Tenant admins who can approve access: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or Azure DevOps Organization Administrator
* End users simply sign in to YakShaver after approval, but they don't grant organization‑wide access

Application permissions:

* vso.graph - read organizational structure, groups, and team memberships across Azure DevOps (used to understand your org structure)
* vso.identity - read user and group identity information across the organization (used to identify users and permissions)
* vso.memberentitlementmanagement - manage user licenses and access levels organization‑wide (used to assign proper permissions)
* vso.profile - read and write user profile information across Azure DevOps (used to manage user settings)
* vso.project - read and manage projects, teams, and project settings organization‑wide (used to access and configure projects)
* vso.work\_write - create, read, update work items, boards, and queries across all projects (core functionality for work management)

Delegated permissions:

* User.Read - read the signed‑in user's basic profile from Microsoft Graph
* user\_impersonation - access Azure DevOps services on behalf of the signed‑in user
