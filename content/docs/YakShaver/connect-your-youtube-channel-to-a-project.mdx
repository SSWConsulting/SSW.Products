Linking your YouTube channel lets YakShaver automatically upload screen recording videos straight to YouTube and [makes your uploads permanent](/docs/make-uploads-permanent). Setting up takes less than a minute.

## Prerequisites

* **Google account with an active YouTube channel** — the channel will host your uploads
* **YakShaver plan** — you must belong to a **Team** subscription (or higher)

## Important Limitations

Before connecting YouTube, consider these limitations:

* **Daily Upload Quota**: YouTube allows only \~100 video uploads per verified channel per day. For high-volume usage, this may cause processing delays when the quota is reached.
* **Security Considerations**: YouTube videos are hosted outside your organization's infrastructure. If unlisted links are accidentally shared, anyone with the link can access them.
* Confidentiality considerations: If your video contains confidential information, even when unlisted, can lead to the video being removed by YouTube. See YouTube's [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567?en-GB\&sjid=6696618074483827073-NA).

**Recommendation**: For teams with high recording volume or sensitive content, consider using SharePoint hosting with adjusted expiry policies instead.

## Step by Step

1. Sign in to the client portal\
   Go to **[Projects](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/projects)** and open the project you want to link.
2. In the "Video Host Type" field\
   Choose "YouTube" as the Video Host
3. Sign in with Google\
   A new browser tab opens. Sign in with the Google account that owns your YouTube channel (or confirm if you are already signed in).
4. Approve the consent screen\
   Google lists the permissions YakShaver needs. Select the channel you want YakShaver to use and choose **Continue**.
5. Close the Google tab\
   After approving the consent screen, close the browser tab to return to YakShaver.

## What Happens Next?

* **Existing work items** — unchanged. The YouTube link applies only to videos recorded *after* you connect.
* **New recordings** — will be uploaded to your channel. YakShaver then updates the video description to include a link back to the newly created work item.
* **Multiple projects** — repeat these same steps in each project that should upload to the same (or a different) YouTube channel.
