Linking your YouTube channel lets YakShaver automatically upload screen recording videos straight to YouTube. Setup takes less than a minute.

## Prerequisites

* **Google account with an active YouTube channel** — the channel will host your uploads
* **YakShaver plan** — you must belong to a **Team** subscription (or higher)

## Step by Step

1. Sign in to the client portal\
   Go to **[Projects](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/projects)** and open the project you want to link.
2. In the "Video Host Type" field\
   Choose "YouTube" as the Video Host
3. Sign in with Google\
   A new browser tab opens. Sign in with the Google account that owns your YouTube channel (or confirm if you are already signed in).
4. Approve the consent screen\
   Google lists the permissions YakShaver needs. Select the channel you want YakShaver to use and choose **Continue**.
5. Close the Google tab\
   After approving the consent screen, close the browser tab to return to YakShaver.

## What Happens Next?

* **Existing work items** — unchanged. The YouTube link applies only to videos recorded *after* you connect.
* **New recordings** — will be uploaded to your channel. YakShaver then updates the video description to include a link back to the newly created work item.
* **Multiple projects** — repeat these same steps in each project that should upload to the same (or a different) YouTube channel.
