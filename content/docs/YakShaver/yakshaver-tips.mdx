Here are some tips to creating the perfect Work Item:

## When recording

### 1. State your intent

Begin the recording with the purpose.

> *‚ÄúSend an email task to...‚Äù*

> *‚ÄúI have a new feature request for SugarLearning...‚Äù*

### 2. Give context

If you're seeing a section you should refer to the section's heading

Note:  Have a look at these [best practices](/docs/giving-context)

### 3. Detail bug reports

For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour.

> *‚ÄúFirst do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this‚Äù*

**Note:** Have a look at [drafting your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

### 4. Mention additional team members

So you include others who are not in the meeting.

> *‚Äú...Cc Adam and Uly‚Äù*

**Note:** Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead. [Why?](/docs/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions)

### 5. Collaborative effort goes a long way

Invite a colleague when recording to allow for multiple perspectives and explanations, allowing for increased clarity and quality of the work item.

## After recording

### 1. Move PBIs (if needed)

If the PBI wasn‚Äôt created in the correct project, use the ‚ÄúMove PBI‚Äù option to relocate it to the right project.

### 2. Review and like the Work Item

Check the PBI title and content. If everything looks good, [react with a üëç to show you‚Äôve reviewed it](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/react-to-reviewed-pbis).

**Note:** You should also do this after checking Work Items created by others.

### 3. Loop in more people

If someone needs to join the conversation later, add "(looping @username)" at the top of the Work Item description.
