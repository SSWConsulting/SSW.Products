Here are some tips to creating the perfect work item!

## 1. **State your intent**

Begin the recording with the purpose.

> *“Send an email task to...”*\\

> *“I have a new feature request for SugarLearning...”*

## 2. **Detail bug reports**

For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour.

> *“First do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this”*

**Note:** Have a look at [Tip #1 - Draft your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

## 3. **Mention additional team members**

So you include others who are not in the meeting.

> *“...Cc Adam and Uly”*

**Note:** Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead. [why?](/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions)

## 4. **Move PBIs**

If the PBI was created in the wrong project, use the “Move PBI” option to relocate it to another project.

## 5. **Collaborative effort goes a long way**

Invite a colleague when recording to allow for multiple perspectives and explanations, allowing for increased clarity and quality of the work item.

## 6. **Check the PBI**

Click "Open Work Item" to view the PBI, check it and like it👍
