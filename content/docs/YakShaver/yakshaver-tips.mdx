Here are some tips to creating the perfect Work Item:

## When recording

### 1. State your intent

Begin the recording by clearly stating the purpose. Avoid being vague. Your goal or the options you’re proposing should be as clear as possible.

> *“Send an email task to...”*
> *“I have a new feature request for SugarLearning...”*

### 2. Give context

Refer to the area of the screen you are discussing. For example, mention the section heading when reviewing a specific section. Explain the user flow as well, such as where you came from and what you are trying to do.

**Note:**  Have a look at these [best practices](/docs/giving-context)

### 3. Detail bug reports

For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour.

> *“First do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this”*

**Note:** Have a look at [drafting your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

### 4. Mention additional team members

Say “CC” and their names so you include people who are not in the meeting.

> *“...Cc Adam and Uly”*

**Note:** Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead. [Why?](/docs/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions)

### 5. Collaborative effort goes a long way

Inviting a colleague to your YakShaver recording brings fresh perspectives and clearer explanations, and because you must walk them through the workflow beforehand, the recording itself becomes a [refined v2](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/email-send-a-v2/) with a stronger final result.

If you're the one added to someone else’s yakshave, contribute meaningfully with helpful comments and extra context whenever you can.

## After recording

### 1. Move PBIs (if needed)

If the PBI wasn’t created in the correct project, use the “Move PBI” option to relocate it to the right project.

### 2. Review and like the Work Item

Check the PBI title and content. If everything looks good, [react with a 👍 to show you’ve reviewed it](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/react-to-reviewed-pbis).

**Note:** You should also do this after checking Work Items created by others.

### 3. Loop in more people

If someone needs to join the conversation later, add "(looping @username)" at the top of the Work Item description.
