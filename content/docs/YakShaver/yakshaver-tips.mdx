Here are some tips to creating the perfect Work Item:


## When recording

### 1. State your intent

Begin the recording with the purpose.

> *“Send an email task to...”*  
> *“I have a new feature request for the Northwind Project...”*

**✅ Good Example:**
>
> “Create a new bug report for the login page in the Northwind project. The issue is users can’t reset their password. (...)”

**❌ Bad Example:**
>
> “This is broken.”

Be as specific as possible so the AI knows what action to take and what project you are refering to. 


**Pro Tip:** A good practice is to end your video by restating your intent and the project name. This reinforces your request and helps the AI generate an accurate Work Item.

## 2. Give context

If you're seeing a section you should refer to the section's heading.

**Note:** Have a look at these [best practices](/docs/giving-context)

**✅ Good Example:**
>
> “On the dashboard, under the ‘Reports’ section, the export button is missing.”

**❌ Bad Example:**
>
> “It’s not working here.”

---

## 3. Detail bug reports

For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour.

> *“First do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this”*

**Note:** Have a look at [drafting your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

**✅ Good Example:**
>
> “Step 1: Go to the login page. Step 2: Enter your email and click ‘Forgot Password’. Step 3: No email is sent. I expect to receive a password reset email.”

**❌ Bad Example:**
>
> “Reset password doesn’t work.”

---

## 4. Mention additional team members

So you include others who are not in the meeting.

> *“...Cc Adam and Uly”*

**Note:** Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead. [Why?](/docs/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions)

**✅ Good Example:**
>
> “Please CC @adam and @uly on this item as they need to review the changes.”

**❌ Bad Example:**
>
> “Let someone else know.”

## 5. Collaborative effort goes a long way

Invite a colleague when recording to allow for multiple perspectives and explanations, allowing for increased clarity and quality of the work item.

**Figure: 2 or more people in a YakShave is always better**

**Tip:** If possible, have another team member present to clarify requirements or add missing details during the recording.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Avoid these common pitfalls to ensure YakShaver produces the best results:

- **Being too vague:** Not stating what you want the AI to do.
  - _Example: “This needs fixing.” (What needs fixing? Where?)_
- **Missing context:** Not mentioning which page, feature, or user role is affected.
- **Skipping steps:** Not describing how to reproduce a bug or what the expected outcome is.
- **Not mentioning key people:** Forgetting to CC or mention stakeholders who need to be involved.
- **Recording in a noisy environment:** Background noise can make it hard for the AI to understand your intent.

Take a moment to review your recording and make sure you’ve avoided these mistakes before submitting.

## Sample Video Script

Here’s an example script for a YakShaver recording that follows best practices.

This script clearly states the intent, provides context, details the bug, mentions key people, and demonstrates collaboration.

```text
Hi team, I’d like to create a new bug report for the login page on the project Northwind. 
When users try to reset their password, no email is sent.  

This is how it happened, I went to the login page and entered my email address. Then I clicked on ‘Forgot Password’.  

After 5 minutes monitoring my email inbox I still haven't received my password reset email.  

Please CC @adam and @uly as they need to review this.  
```

## Quick Reference: Do’s and Don’ts

Refer to this table before recording to maximize the quality of your YakShaver Work Items!

| ✅ Do’s | ❌ Don’ts |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Clearly state your intent      | Be vague or ambiguous         |
| Give specific context (page, feature, etc.) | Assume the AI knows what you mean |
| List steps to reproduce bugs   | Skip important details        |
| Mention/CC relevant team members | Forget to involve stakeholders |
| Record in a quiet environment  | Record with lots of background noise |
| Collaborate with others when possible | Work in isolation if clarity is needed |
