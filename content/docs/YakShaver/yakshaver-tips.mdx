Here are some tips to creating the perfect work item!

## When recording

### 1. **State your intent**

Begin the recording with the purpose.

> *‚ÄúSend an email task to...‚Äù*\

> *‚ÄúI have a new feature request for SugarLearning...‚Äù*

### 2. **Detail bug reports**

For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour.

> *‚ÄúFirst do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this‚Äù*

**Note:** Have a look at [Tip #1 - Draft your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

### 3. **Mention additional team members**

So you include others who are not in the meeting.

> *‚Äú...Cc Adam and Uly‚Äù*

**Note:** Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead. [why?](/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions)

## 4. **Collaborative effort goes a long way**

Invite a colleague when recording to allow for multiple perspectives and explanations, allowing for increased clarity and quality of the work item.

## After recording

## 1. **Move PBIs (if needed)**

If the PBI wasn‚Äôt created in the correct project, use the ‚ÄúMove PBI‚Äù option to relocate it to the right project.

## 2. **Review and like the Work Item**

Check the title and content. If everything looks good, add a üëç to show you‚Äôve reviewed it.

**Note:** You should also do this when reviewing Work Items created by others.

## 3. **Loop in more people**

If someone needs to join the conversation later, add "(looping {{ PERSON(S) }})" at the top of the Work Item description.
