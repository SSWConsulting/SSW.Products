Here are some tips to creating the perfect work item!

### 1. State your intent

Begin the recording with the purpose.

> *“Send an email task to...”*\
> *“I have a new feature request for SugarLearning...”*

### 2. Detail bug reports

For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour.

> *“First do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this”*

**Note:** Have a look at [Tip #1 - Draft your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

### 3. Mention additional team members

So you include others who are not in the meeting.

> *“...Cc Adam and Uly”*

**Note:** Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead. [why?](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions)

### 4. Move PBIs

If the PBI was created in the wrong project, use the “Move PBI” option to relocate it to another project.

### 5. Collaborative effort goes a long way

Invite a colleague when recording to allow for multiple perspectives and explanations, allowing for increased clarity and quality of the work item.
