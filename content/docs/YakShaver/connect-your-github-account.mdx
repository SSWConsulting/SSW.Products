## How to Connect your GitHub account to YakShaver

1. Go to YakShaver bot on Microsoft Teams, in the chatbox type 'github' to check your GitHub status

* If you don't have a connected account, you'll be prompted to connect to your personal GitHub account
* If you have connected an account, you can see the username of the connected account, and the ability to reconnect if there were any issues connecting

1. Check that your User has the linked GitHub account in the [user settings](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/users)
2. ✅ You're done! Now every time you create a work item using YakShaver for a GitHub project, it'll be as if you created it.

### What are the benefits of Connecting your GitHub account to YakShaver?

1. Your GitHub Username on Issues – Issues show up under your GitHub account, so everyone knows who reported them without needing to see the description. You also get [GitHub contribution activity](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile#what-counts-as-a-contribution) for this!
2. Notifications – You’ll get GitHub alerts when someone updates or comments on your issue.
3. Permissions – The issue follows your GitHub access settings.
4. Attention – Issue requests from real users get more attention than those from a bot.
