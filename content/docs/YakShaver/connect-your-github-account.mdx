## How to connect your GitHub account to YakShaver

1. If you are using Microsoft Teams, Go to Microsoft Teams | YakShaver bot | in the chatbox type 'github' to check your GitHub status

   * If you don't have a connected account, you'll be prompted to connect to your personal GitHub account
   * If you have connected an account, you can see the username of the connected account, and the ability to reconnect if there were any issues connecting

2. In the YakShaver portal [user settings](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/users), check that your user has your GitHub username listed, otherwise you can connect your github projects there

3. ✅ You're done!

### What are the benefits of connecting your GitHub account to YakShaver?

1. **Your GitHub Username on Issues** – Issues show up under your GitHub account, so everyone knows who reported them without needing to see the description. You also get [GitHub contribution activity](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile#what-counts-as-a-contribution) for this!
2. **Notifications** – You’ll get GitHub alerts when someone updates or comments on your issue.
3. **Permissions** – The issue follows your GitHub access settings.
4. **Attention** – Issue requests from real users get more attention than those from a bot.

**Note:** If you don't have permission to a backlog, YakShaver can still create work items there, but you won't get the contribution.
