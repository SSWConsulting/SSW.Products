## 1. Does YakShaver work in all languages? (More than just English)

Yes, Yakshaver works in most of the world's languages. [See supported OpenAI list](https://github.com/openai/whisper?tab=readme-ov-file#available-models-and-languages).

See examples of issues created from recordings in [Chinese](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/Northwind365/issues/162) and [French](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/Northwind365/issues/168).

## 2. Do I need a certified person to use YakShaver at my company?

SSW recommends that you have someone who understands YakShaver at your organization. They can act as your first port of call in case any configuration needs updating, or anything doesn't work as expected. SSW offers a free certification program and upon successful completion your organization will receive 50 free credits valued at $25. [Click here to apply](https://yakshaver.ai/certifications).

## 3. When should I *not* use YakShaver?

YakShaver is great for giving context and showing exactly what the user experiences. In specific cases when you're requesting small **text changes** (rewording, improvements to phrasing, or tone adjustments) and know which project and people to action - it's better to create the Issue or PBI manually.

In these cases, follow the SSW rule ["Do you ask for small content changes using from X to Y?"](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/change-from-x-to-y). This ensures clarity, intent, and better collaboration with the person responsible for the content.

## 4. I've just created a Work Item, what do these buttons do?

It's actually pretty simple!

* **Open Work Item:** Opens the issue in your preferred browser
* **Move Work Item:** If you created a work item in the wrong project, it allows you to move it to the right project
* **Close Work Item:** If you created a work item by mistake, it allows you to close the work item

## 5. What happens if I don’t mention the project name in the video?

If YakShaver can’t determine the project, or its confidence scroe is low, it will display a disambiguation card so you can manually select the correct project.

## 6. Why are so many people CC'd on my Work Item?

When a work item is created, anyone mentioned in the transcript is automatically added to the conversation. For project-related items, the primary contact and all project members are also tagged to ensure visibility and alignment across the team.

***

## 7. Why are my GitHub issues being created by YakShaver instead of my account?

To create and edit issues under your GitHub account, you'll need to connect your GitHub account to YakShaver. This ensures issues are properly attributed to you and gives you full editing capabilities. See [Connect your GitHub account](/docs/connect-your-github-account) for setup instructions.

## 8. How do I fully remove confidential info from GitHub Issues?

If you accidentally include sensitive content (e.g. passwords, private data) in a GitHub Issue recorded via YakShaver, **editing the issue isn’t enough**. GitHub keeps a full revision history. See [how to fully remove confidential info from GitHub Issues](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/remove-confidential-information-from-github).

## 9. My Shave got taken down from YouTube, what happened?

Your video was likely removed because YouTube determined it violated their [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567?hl=en). When recording your screen, be mindful not to display confidential or sensitive information such as personal details, account data, or private communications. Reviewing your recordings before uploading and familiarizing yourself with YouTube’s policies can help prevent future removals.
