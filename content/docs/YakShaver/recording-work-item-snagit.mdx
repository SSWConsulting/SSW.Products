Here's how you can set up Snagit to get your videos processed by YakShaver!

### ⚠️ Important: Before you begin

1. Open YakShaver in Microsoft Teams
2. Type **OFF** in the YakShaver Teams bot\
   (This prevents processing of old videos during setup)

### Set up your Library

1. Open Snagit Editor
2. In the toolbar, select **Edit | Editor Preferences**
3. Open the **Library** tab
4. Change the library location to your OneDrive Recordings' folder. i.e. `OneDrive/Recordings/Snagit/`
   **Note:** make
5. Click OK, which will prompt you to restart Snagit
