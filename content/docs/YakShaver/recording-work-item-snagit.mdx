Here's how you can set up Snagit to get your videos processed by YakShaver!

### ⚠️ Important: Turn off YakShaver before you begin

1. Open YakShaver in Microsoft Teams
2. Type **OFF** in the YakShaver Teams bot\
 (Snagit will copy all the existing files to the new location, this prevents processing of old videos during setup)

### Set up your Library

1. Open Snagit Editor
2. In the toolbar, select **Edit | Editor Preferences**
3. Open the **Library** tab
4. Change the library location to your OneDrive Recordings' folder. i.e. `OneDrive/Recordings/Snagit/`
   **Note:** This moves all your files and folders to the new location. Backup or remove anything you don’t want shared.
5. Click OK, which will prompt you to restart Snagit
6. After configuring Snagit and OneDrive files have been fully synced, type **ON** in YakShaver to reactivate processing

### Recording a video with Snagit

1. In Snagit, ensure that "All-in-one" is selected
2. Click the Capture button or your capture hotkey (we recommend using “Print Screen”)
3. When done, stop the recording and wait for YakShaver to process the video
