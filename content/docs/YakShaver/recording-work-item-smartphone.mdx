Need to YakShave from your phone? You’ve got two easy options:

## Option 1: Recording with your smartphone

You can record either with the **camera app** or by **recording your screen**. In both cases, upload the video to **OneDrive → Recordings**, and YakShaver will automatically process it.

##### Prerequisites

* OneDrive App installed, signed in to the account you want the YakShave to be picked up from
* Ensure that YakShaver is “**ask**“ or ”**on**"

### A. Record with the Camera App

1. Open the Camera app → switch to Video mode.
2. Tap Record and capture your YakShave.
3. Your video will be saved in your phone’s Photos/Gallery app.
4. Open the saved video → Share/Upload to OneDrive → Recordings.
5. YakShaver will automatically pick up the video and update you on Teams.

### B. Record Your Screen

#### Android

1. Swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal the Quick Settings and click on the Screen Record button. If you can't find it, you may have to add it there.
