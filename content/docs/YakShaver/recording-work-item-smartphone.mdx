If you ever need to record a YakShave from your smartphone (mobile app, responsive website, â€¦), you have 2 options at your disposal

## Option 1: Recording your smartphone's screen

The process is easy, just record your screen (don't forget to include microphone audio) and then upload the recording to your Recordings OneDrive folder. Then YakShaver will pick up the video and processs it.

You can use any screen recording software but the easiest way is to use your smartphone's screen recording app.

### Android

1. Swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal the Quick Settings and click on the Screen Record button. If you can't find it, you may have to add it there.
