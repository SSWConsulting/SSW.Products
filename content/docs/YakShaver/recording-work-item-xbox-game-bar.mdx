## Setting up Xbox Game Bar (Windows)

If you are on Windows, you can use the built-in **Xbox Game Bar** to record videos that are automatically processed by YakShaver.

### One-time setup

1\. **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: YakShaver | Type **OFF** in the YakShaver Teams bot. This will prevent old videos from being processed.

2\. In your OneDrive **Recordings** folder, create a new folder called **Captures**

Example:

OneDrive\Recordings\Captures

3\. Go to `C:\Users\{{ YOUR USERNAME }}\Videos` (replace `{{ YOUR USERNAME }}` with your Windows username)

4\. You should see a folder named `Captures`, if not, create it.

5\. Right click the `Captures` folder and select **Properties.**

6\. In the properties window, go to the **Location** tab and click on the **Move** button

7\. Select the folder you created in Step 1 and click **OK**

8\. When prompted to Move all files, choose Yes, so that other programs can still use your old recordings.

### Recording a video

1\. Start recording by pressing **Windows + Alt + R**

2\. Alternatively, press **Windows + G** to open Xbox Game Bar, then select **Start recording** (●) from the Capture widget.

3\. Record your screen as usual.

4\. Stop the recording.

YakShaver will automatically detect the recording and turn it into a work item.

📄 **Note:** Xbox Game Bar can only record app windows, not the full desktop or File Explorer.
