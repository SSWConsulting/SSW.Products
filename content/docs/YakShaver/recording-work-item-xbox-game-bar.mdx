## Setting up Xbox Game Bar (Windows)

If you are on Windows, you can use the built-in **Xbox Game Bar** to record videos that are automatically processed by YakShaver.

### One-time setup

1\. In your OneDrive **Recordings** folder, create a new folder called **XboxGameBar**\
Example:

OneDrive\Recordings\XboxGameBar

2\. Press **Windows + G** to open **Xbox Game Bar**.

3\. Open **Settings** (⚙️).

4\. Go to **Capturing**.

5\. Under **Captures location**, change the folder to the **XboxGameBar** folder you just created.

6\. Make sure **Microphone recording** is enabled so your voice is captured.

### Recording a video

1. Press **Windows + G** to open Xbox Game Bar.
2. Start recording (●) from the Capture widget or press **Windows + Alt + R**.
3. Record your screen as usual.
4. Stop the recording.

YakShaver will automatically detect the recording and turn it into a work item.

📄 **Note:** Xbox Game Bar can only record app windows, not the full desktop or File Explorer.
