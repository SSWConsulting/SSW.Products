## Setting up Xbox Game Bar (Windows)

If you are on Windows, you can use the built-in **Xbox Game Bar** to record videos that are automatically processed by YakShaver.

### One-time setup

1\. **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: YakShaver | Type OFF in the YakShaver Teams bot. This will prevent old videos from being processed.

2. In your OneDrive **Recordings** folder, create a new folder called **XboxGameBar**\
Example:

OneDrive\Recordings\XboxGameBar

3. Go to `C:\Users\{{ YOUR USERNAME}}\Videos` (replace `{{ YOUR USERNAME }}` with your Windows username)

4. You should see a folder named `Captures`, if not, create it.

5. Right click the `Captures` folder and select **Properties.**

6. In the properties window, go to the **Location** tab and click on the **Move** button

7. Select the folder you created in Step 1 and click **Apply and OK**

8\. When prompted to Move all files, choose Yes, so that other programs can still use your old recordings.

### Recording a video

1. Press **Windows + G** to open Xbox Game Bar.
2. Start recording (●) from the Capture widget or press **Windows + Alt + R**.
3. Record your screen as usual.
4. Stop the recording.

YakShaver will automatically detect the recording and turn it into a work item.

📄 **Note:** Xbox Game Bar can only record app windows, not the full desktop or File Explorer.
