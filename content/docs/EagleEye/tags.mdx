## Introduction

The EagleEye system supports three types of tags for categorizing and analyzing emails:

1. **Non-AI Tags** - Simple rules-based tags
2. **AI Tags** - AI-powered tags with basic validation
3. **AI with Mentions Tags** - AI-powered tags that can extract and identify specific people mentioned in emails

## Best Practices

### 1. Rule Design

* Keep rules simple and specific
* Use multiple rules with appropriate logic (AND/OR) for complex conditions
* Test rules thoroughly with various email scenarios

### 2. AI Prompts

* Be clear and specific in prompt instructions
* Include examples in the prompt when possible
* Test prompts with various email formats and content

### 3. Mentions Extraction

* Always specify the expected response format
* Consider using the "Extract names from everyone" option when names might appear anywhere in the email
* Test with various name formats and positions in the email

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Non-AI Tags

* Project-specific tags (e.g., "SSW\.Design", "SSW\.Marketing")
* Simple categorization based on email properties

### 2. AI Tags

* Task completion detection
* Sentiment analysis
* Topic categorization

### 3. AI with Mentions Tags

* Email checking verification
* Meeting participant identification
* Action item assignment tracking
