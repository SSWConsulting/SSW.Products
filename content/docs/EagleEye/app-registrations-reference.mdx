This reference guide explains:

* What the Master app is
* What app registrations are created by the Master app
* Why each permission is required

## Overview

EagleEye uses one orchestrator [app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) to create and configure everything it needs.

We call this the **Master app**.

You can give it any name when creating it, for example: `Northwind.EagleEye.Master`

## What the Master app does during installation

1. You create the Master app in [Step 2 - App Registration](./step-2-app-registrations) and grant the required Graph permissions to it.
2. During deployment, the Master app creates these three app registrations:
   * `Engine`
   * `Api`
   * `Portal`
3. Then it:
   * Grants Graph permission to `Engine`
   * Grants delegated API access to `Portal`
   * Assigns the configured Entra group to `Portal`
   * Reads your tenant email domains (e.g. @northwind.com, @company.com) and stores them in the database

## Master App - Required Permissions

When creating the Master app ([Step 2 - App Registration](./step-2-app-registrations)), we assign the following Microsoft Graph **Application** permissions.

These must be Application permissions (not Delegated), because deployment is automated and non-interactive.

| Permission                               | Why it is needed                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy`          | Create and update the Engine, API, and Portal app registrations                                                     |
| `AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All`        | Grant application permissions to the Engine app (for example, Engine -> Microsoft Graph)                            |
| `DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All` | Grant delegated API access to Portal app (Portal -> API)                                                            |
| `Domain.Read.All`                        | Read tenant domains for EagleEye email settings and store them in the database                                      |
| `Group.Read.All`                         | Read groups and group memberships so deployment can find the configured Entra group and assign it to the Portal app |

## 3 App Registrations Created by Master App

EagleEye uses three app registrations, each with a single clear responsibility.

### `Engine`

**Purpose:** Email analysis

* Reads mailboxes
* Resolves users and groups
* Used by background jobs and CLI

Think of Engine as the worker that does the actual email processing.

### `Api`

**Purpose:** Backend API

* Exposes EagleEye data and operations
* Acts as the bridge between Portal and Engine

Think of API as the backend glue that connects everything.

### `Portal`

**Purpose:** Web Portal

* Users sign in here
* Run scans, see reports, and create tags
* Access is restricted by Entra group assignment

Think of Portal as the frontend users interact with.
