Every single report can have its own personalized description.

This description can be set in the Tag dialog and will appear on the report itself, just under the report name.

**Note:** If a "documentation link" is added in the Tag, it will also appear just below the description.

We have a video that goes through the Tag dialog UI and covers the report description section (from 2:12 to 3:14).
