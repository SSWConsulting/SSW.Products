> By default, EagleEye automatically adds all the tenant's email domains during the first deployment.  

These domains help EagleEye identify **internal users** within your organization.

If your company uses **multiple email domains**, you can easily update this list at any time.

## How to Manage Internal Email Domains

1. Open the **Portal**  
2. Navigate to **Settings → Internal Emails**  
3. Add or remove domains as required
