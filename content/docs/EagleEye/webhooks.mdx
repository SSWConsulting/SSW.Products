## What are webhooks

A webhook is a way for an application to provide other systems with real-time information. It sends an HTTP request (usually a POST) to a specified URL when a particular event occurs. Unlike traditional APIs that require regular polling for updates, webhooks push data automatically, making them faster and more efficient for event-driven systems. 

## Why using webhooks

Webhooks can be useful in many situations:

* Real-time automation: Trigger actions instantly when certain keywords or tags are detected in emails, such as notifying a Slack channel or updating a CRM. 
* Integration with external systems: Seamlessly connect your AI tool to other platforms or workflows, like project management tools, without manual intervention. 
* Custom workflows: Enable tailored responses such as forwarding tagged emails to specific departments, starting a workflow in Zapier, or updating a database. 

## Examples

 Here are some examples of how webhooks can be used with this AI tool:

* When an email contains a list of tasks, a webhook can move this email into a separate folder named "TODOs". 
* When an email contains the tag #urgent, a webhook sends a message to a Microsoft Teams channel to alert the operations team. 
* If an email mentions #newlead, the webhook triggers a call to the CRM systemâ€™s API to create a new lead entry automatically. 
* For any email tagged with #support, a webhook opens a new support ticket in Jira or Zendesk with the email contents. 
* Emails tagged with #invoice trigger a webhook that uploads the email to an accounting tool or flags it for finance review.
