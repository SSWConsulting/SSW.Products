Non-AI tags use a simple rules-based system to categorize emails. These tags are the most straightforward to implement and are suitable for cases where the categorization logic can be expressed through clear rules.

## How to create a non-AI tag

1. **Basic information**
   * Name: The display name of the tag
   * Description: Optional description of the tag's purpose
   * Link: Optional URL to related documentation or rules
2. **Rules configuration**
   * Rules are based on email properties (subject, body, sender, etc.)
   * Each rule consists of:
     * Rule Type (e.g., Subject, Body, Sender)
     * Condition Type (e.g., Contains, Equals, StartsWith)
     * Data (the value to match against)

```json
{
  "RuleType": "Subject",
    "ConditionType": "Contains",
      "Data": "SSW.Design"
}
```

## Example

Here is an example of a rule that we use to find emails about Sprint Review and Retro.
