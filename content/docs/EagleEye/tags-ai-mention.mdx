AI with Mentions tags are the most sophisticated type, combining AI analysis with the ability to identify and extract specific people mentioned in the email content.

## How to create an AI with mentions tag

1. **Basic information**
   * Same as other tag types
   * Tag Type: Select "ðŸ¤– AI @Mentions"
2. **Rules configuration**
   * Similar to other tag types
   * Used as initial filters for the AI processing
3. **Checking prompt**
   * Required for initial validation
   * Determines if the tag should be applied
4. **Extracting prompt**
   * Required for AI with Mentions tags
   * Instructs the AI how to identify and extract people mentioned in the email
   * Must specify the expected response format:

```json
{
  "Result": ["Full Name1", "Full Name2", ...],
    "ConfidencePercentage": XX
}
```

5\. **Example prompt:**

```
 Identify who checked this email.
 Look for phrases like "(Checked by XXX)" or similar patterns.
  Return the full names of people who checked the email.
```

6\. **Extract names options**

* "Extract names from everyone" option:
  * When enabled: AI will look for names throughout the entire email
  * When disabled: AI will only look for names in the recipients list

## Example

Here is an example of a prompt that we use to scan emails that were checked by someone else.
