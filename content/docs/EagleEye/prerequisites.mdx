## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following:

### Azure Subscription

* An active [Azure Subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings)

### Microsoft Entra Tenant

* An [Microsoft Entra tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/what-is-entra) (Azure AD)

### Azure OpenAI Quota

* EagleEye uses a tested default model (`gpt-4.1-mini`)
* More AI models will be available in future EagleEye releases and configurable directly from the EagleEye Portal

Ensure you have sufficient quota for this model in your Azure subscription.
Check or request quota in the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/quota?view=foundry-classic#view-and-request-quotas-in-foundry-portal).

> **Tip:** The Foundry portal only shows quotas if you already have an Azure OpenAI resource. If you don't have one yet, use [Azure Cloud Shell](https://portal.azure.com/#cloudshell/) to check your quota:

1\. In Azure Portal, go to **Subscriptions** and copy your **Subscription ID**.

```bash
SUB_ID="{{ your azure subscription id }}"
```

2\. Run the quota check:

```bash
az rest \
  --method get \
  --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$SUB_ID/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/locations/eastus/usages?api-version=2023-05-01" \
  --query "value[?name.value == 'OpenAI.GlobalStandard.gpt4.1-mini'].{Model:name.value,Current:currentValue,Limit:limit}" \
  -o table
```
Output:
```txt

Model                              Current    Limit
---------------------------------  ---------  -------
OpenAI.GlobalStandard.gpt4.1-mini  100        5000
```

**Current** = tokens per minute already allocated. **Limit** = your maximum available.

### Custom Domain (optional)

* A [custom domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/add-custom-domain) and [DNS zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records) in Azure (needed if you want a custom URL to access EagleEye Portal)

## Required Permissions

> **Tip:** You don't need to hold these roles yourself. You just need access to someone who does (usually a SysAdmin or IT admin in your organisation). You can complete most steps yourself and only ask your SysAdmin to perform the specific actions that require elevated privileges, such as granting admin consent.

### Azure Subscription

* **[Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner)** role on the Azure subscription
  * Required to deploy from the Marketplace and assign roles during deployment
  * See [Assign a user as an administrator of an Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-subscription-admin)

### Microsoft Entra Tenant

* **[Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator)** role in your Entra tenant
  * Required to create an App Registration and **grant admin consent** for Microsoft Graph permissions in [Step 2 - App Registrations](./step-2-app-registrations)
  * Note: Application Administrator is **not sufficient**. Granting admin consent for `AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All` and `DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All` requires Global Administrator
  * See [Assign Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal)
